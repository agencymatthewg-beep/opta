# /100 - Capture Must-Have Idea

You are capturing a must-have feature or requirement for Opta.

## Process

1. **Read current must-haves**: Use Read tool on `.planning/MUST_HAVE.md`

2. **Parse the user's idea** from the message that triggered this command

3. **Clarify the vision** - Ask questions if ANY of these are unclear:
   - What exactly should happen? (specific behavior)
   - When/where should it appear? (context/trigger)
   - What problem does this solve? (the "why")
   - Any edge cases or exceptions?

4. **Confirm understanding** - Summarize the idea back in 1-2 sentences

5. **Add to MUST_HAVE.md** - Use Edit tool to add a bullet point under the appropriate section:
   - **Features** - User-facing functionality
   - **UX / Design** - Visual/interaction requirements
   - **Technical** - Architecture/performance requirements
   - **Integrations** - External tools/APIs

## Bullet Point Format

```markdown
- **[Short Name]**: [One clear sentence describing exactly what this does and why]
```

## Example

User says: `/100 I want the optimization score to animate when it changes`

You ask: "When you say animate - do you mean a counting animation (like 72 -> 85), a visual effect (glow/pulse), or both? And should this happen every time it updates or only on significant changes?"

User clarifies: "Counting animation with a subtle glow, only when it changes by more than 5 points"

You add:
```markdown
- **Score Animation**: Counting animation with subtle glow effect when optimization score changes by 5+ points
```

## Response Format

After adding:

```
Added to MUST_HAVE.md under [Section]:

- **[Name]**: [Description]

[Any notes about implementation timing or dependencies]
```
