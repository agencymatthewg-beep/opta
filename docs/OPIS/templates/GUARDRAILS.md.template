# [Project Name] — Guardrails

> Hard rules that must NEVER be violated. Read before writing code.

---

## Global Compliance (Inherited — Do Not Modify)

From `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2A-Compliance/RULES-GLOBAL.md`:

- **C01:** No data exfiltration without approval
- **C02:** No destructive commands without "yes, delete"
- **C03:** No external posts/emails without approval
- **C04:** No modifying RULES-GLOBAL.md
- **C05:** No bypassing authentication
- **C06:** No executing untrusted code without review

## Credential Management

- **NEVER** hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or secrets
- **Source of truth:** `~/Synced/AI26/1-SOT/1C-Accounts/MASTER-KEYS.md`
- Use environment variables or gitignored config files
- Rotate keys if accidentally committed (immediate action)

## Platform Rules

<!-- OPIS: Populated from Stage 1 Question 7 answers -->
(e.g., "iOS 17+ only", "No external dependencies", "Pure SwiftUI")

## Performance Floors

<!-- OPIS: Populated from Stage 1 Question 5 + Stage 3 refinement -->
(e.g., "Startup under 2 seconds", "API response under 50ms")

## Architecture Rules

<!-- OPIS: Populated from ARCHITECTURE.md key constraints -->
(e.g., "Never block the main thread", "All I/O must be async")

## Anti-Features (Explicitly Rejected)

<!-- OPIS: Populated from Stage 1 Question 6 + APP.md "Does NOT Do" -->
(e.g., "No GUI — this is headless only", "No cloud API proxying")

## Testing Requirements

<!-- OPIS: Populated from Stage 3 refinement -->
(e.g., "All public APIs must have integration tests", "Build must pass before merge")

*Violating these rules is a bug. If a guardrail needs changing, update this file and record in DECISIONS.md.*
