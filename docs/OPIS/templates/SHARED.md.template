# [App Name] — Shared Foundation

> What both platforms share: backend, data models, API contracts, design language.

---

## Backend / API Contracts

### Connection
<!-- OPIS: Protocol (WebSocket, REST, etc.), endpoints, auth -->

### Data Models
<!-- OPIS: Shared types/models consumed by both platforms -->

### API Endpoints Used
<!-- OPIS: What both apps talk to -->

---

## Design Language

### Brand Identity
<!-- OPIS: Colors, fonts, visual identity shared across platforms -->

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Primary | | |
| Background | | |
| Text | | |
| Accent | | |

### Typography
<!-- OPIS: Shared font families, scale -->

### Iconography
<!-- OPIS: Icon style, source (SF Symbols, custom, etc.) -->

### Motion Principles
<!-- OPIS: Animation philosophy shared across both platforms -->

---

## Feature Parity Matrix

Every feature declares its platform status:

| Feature | macOS | iOS | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----|-------|
<!-- OPIS: Populated from Stage 1 Q7b + Stage 3 platform refinement -->

**Legend:**
- ✅ Full — Feature exists with complete functionality
- ✅ Simplified — Feature exists with reduced scope
- ❌ N/A — Not applicable to this platform
- 🔄 Different UX — Same function, platform-native presentation

---

## Shared Code / Modules

<!-- OPIS: Code that's literally shared between platforms (Swift packages, shared models, etc.) -->

| Module | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
<!-- OPIS: Shared Swift packages, networking layer, etc. -->

---

## Authentication / Identity

<!-- OPIS: If applicable — how users authenticate, shared across platforms -->

---

## Data Sync

<!-- OPIS: How data stays in sync between platforms (iCloud, backend, file-based, etc.) -->
