# [App Name] — macOS Platform Profile

> Command Center. Full power. Maximum density. Keyboard-first.

---

## macOS Philosophy

This is the **expanded** version. Everything iOS has, plus desktop-exclusive capabilities that leverage:
- Larger screen (14-38" ultrawide)
- Keyboard + mouse/trackpad precision
- Multi-window support
- Persistent background operation
- Higher compute/memory availability

**Design rule:** If you can show it without cluttering, show it. macOS users have the screen space and input precision to handle density.

## macOS-Exclusive Features

| # | Feature | Why Desktop-Only |
|---|---------|-----------------|
<!-- OPIS: From Stage 1 Q7b + Stage 3 macOS refinement -->

## Expanded Features (Shared but Enhanced)

| Feature | iOS Version | macOS Expansion |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
<!-- OPIS: Features that exist on both but are richer on macOS -->

## UX Patterns

### Navigation
- **Sidebar** for primary navigation (collapsible)
- **Multi-window** via ⌘N (independent state per window)
- **Tab bar** within windows for sub-sections
- **Menu bar** integration (always accessible)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
<!-- OPIS: From Stage 3 macOS questions -->

### Information Density
- Multi-panel layouts (sidebar + main + inspector)
- Tables, detailed logs, expanded metadata visible by default
- Hover states for additional context
- Resizable panels

### Window Management
- Remember window positions across launches
- Support macOS Stage Manager and Spaces
- Aerospace tiling WM compatibility
- Full screen support
