# Phase 3.1 Plan 03: Restyle Telemetry, ProcessList, and StealthMode Summary

**Telemetry meters, process list, and Stealth Mode restyled with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind for cohesive futuristic theme**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-15T07:05:15Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-15T07:11:22Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 7
- **CSS files deleted:** 7

## Accomplishments

- Restyled TelemetryCard with shadcn Card, SVG icons with primary color tint, and hover glow effects
- Updated CPU/GPU circular meters with CSS variable colors, dynamic glow based on usage, and smooth transitions
- Updated Memory/Disk bar meters with gradient fills, glow effects, and consistent thresholds
- Restyled ProcessList with shadcn Table, Badge components for categories, and ScrollArea for scrolling
- Restyled StealthMode with hero button (pulse glow, sweep animation) and shadcn Dialog

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Restyle TelemetryCard and meter components** - `4c8c93d` (feat) - *Already completed in prior 03.1-02 session*
2. **Task 2: Restyle ProcessList component** - `2e7ab8a` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Restyle StealthMode component** - `690f330` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/TelemetryCard.tsx` - shadcn Card with typed icon props (cpu, memory, gpu, disk)
- `src/components/CpuMeter.tsx` - SVG ring with CSS variable colors and glow
- `src/components/GpuMeter.tsx` - SVG ring with temperature badge
- `src/components/MemoryMeter.tsx` - Gradient bar with glow effect
- `src/components/DiskMeter.tsx` - Gradient bar with TB formatting
- `src/components/ProcessList.tsx` - shadcn Table, Badge, ScrollArea, Button
- `src/components/StealthMode.tsx` - shadcn Dialog, Button with hero styling

**Deleted CSS files:**
- TelemetryCard.css, CpuMeter.css, GpuMeter.css, MemoryMeter.css, DiskMeter.css, ProcessList.css, StealthMode.css

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| CSS variable colors for meters | Enables consistent theming and easy color changes |
| shadcn Table with ScrollArea | Better accessibility and consistent scrollbar styling |
| Hero button with pulse glow | StealthMode should feel POWERFUL as the main action |
| shadcn Dialog for modals | Accessible, animated, consistent with design system |

## Deviations from Plan

Task 1 (TelemetryCard and meter components) was already completed in a prior session as part of commit 4c8c93d. The work was done but not tracked as a separate plan. Tasks 2 and 3 were completed in this session.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All data visualization components restyled with cohesive futuristic theme
- StealthMode feels premium with prominent glow effects
- Design system Phase 3.1 is complete
- Ready for Phase 4: Optimization Engine
