# Opta

**One tool to rule them all.** Opta is an AI-powered PC optimization orchestrator that replaces the chaos of multiple conflicting optimizers with a single, intelligent system.

## Why Opta?

Most gamers run 3-5 optimization tools (GeForce Experience, Razer Cortex, MSI Afterburner, etc.) that conflict with each other, create confusion, and often do more harm than good. Opta:

- **Detects conflicts** between optimization tools and warns you
- **Explains every change** so you understand what's happening
- **Learns your preferences** and adapts recommendations over time
- **Measures results** with before/after benchmarking

## Features

### 🎮 Game Optimization
- Auto-detect installed games across Steam, Epic, GOG
- Apply community-verified optimal settings
- Before/after benchmarking to prove gains

### 📊 Hardware Telemetry
- Real-time CPU, GPU, RAM monitoring
- Temperature and utilization tracking
- Process management with "Stealth Mode"

### 🧠 AI-Powered Assistance
- Local LLM for privacy-first, instant responses
- Cloud AI for complex optimization strategies
- Context-aware recommendations based on your hardware

### 🏆 Optimization Score
- Three-dimensional scoring: Performance, Experience, Competitive
- Compare with friends and global leaderboards
- Track improvement over time

## Installation

## First Launch

When you first open Opta, you'll be greeted with a quick onboarding:

### Question 1: What's your priority?
Choose what matters most to you:
- **Maximum FPS** - Prioritize frame rate above all
- **Visual Quality** - Keep games looking great
- **Balanced** - Best of both worlds

### Question 2: How technical are you?
This sets your experience level:
- **Keep it simple** - Plain language, safer optimizations

- **GPU Usage** - Graphics card load
- **Memory Usage** - RAM consumption

### Process List
Shows running processes that might impact gaming:
- Category (System, App, Background)
- CPU and memory usage
- Click to see details or terminate

### Quick Actions
One-click optimizations:
- **Stealth Mode** - Kill unnecessary background processes
- **Optimize Game** - Apply settings to detected games

## Your First Optimization

1. Navigate to **Games** in the sidebar
2. Opta auto-scans for installed games
3. Click a game to see optimization options
4. Review suggested changes (Opta explains each one)
5. Click **Apply** to optimize
6. Check your **Score** to see improvement

## Understanding Your Score

The Opta Score has three dimensions:

### Performance (40%)
- FPS Potential
- Stability (no stutters)
- Load Times

### Experience (35%)
- Visual Quality
- Thermal Efficiency
- System Responsiveness

### Competitive (25%)
- Input Lag
- Network Latency
- Background Interference

## What's Next?

- [Learn about all features](FEATURES.md)
- [Read the FAQ](FAQ.md)
- Enable Learn Mode to understand optimizations better

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Opta?
Opta is an AI-powered PC optimization tool that helps you get the best performance from your gaming setup. Unlike other tools, Opta explains what it's doing and learns your preferences over time.

### Is Opta free?
Yes, Opta is free and open source. Some cloud AI features may have usage limits.

### What platforms are supported?
Windows 10+, macOS 10.13+, and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora 35+).

## Features

### Do I need to uninstall other optimization tools?
No. Opta will detect them and warn about potential conflicts, but you decide what to keep. We recommend disabling overlapping features rather than uninstalling.

### What games does Opta support?
Opta auto-detects games from Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy. You can also manually add any game.

### Does Opta work with AMD GPUs?
Yes. GPU telemetry works with both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, though some features may be more complete on NVIDIA due to driver support.

## Privacy

### Does Opta send data to the cloud?
By default, no. All preferences and history are stored locally. The local LLM handles queries on your machine.

Cloud AI is opt-in and only used for complex questions. When used, context is anonymized (no personal info, file paths, or usernames sent).

### Can I see what data Opta stores?
Yes. Go to Settings → Privacy → View Stored Data. You can view, export, or delete everything.

### How do I delete my data?
Settings → Privacy → Delete All Data. This removes all preferences, history, and learned patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Opta isn't detecting my GPU
1. Ensure GPU drivers are up to date
2. For NVIDIA: nvidia-smi should work from command line
3. For AMD: ROCm or amdgpu drivers required on Linux
4. Opta will still work with basic telemetry if GPU detection fails

### Game detection missed a game
Click "Add Game" and browse to the game executable. Opta will create a profile.

### Local AI isn't working
The local LLM requires Ollama:
1. Install Ollama from ollama.ai
2. Run: `ollama pull llama3:8b`
3. Restart Opta

### Optimization made things worse
Don't worry! Every change is reversible:
1. Go to the game's optimization history
2. Click "Rollback" on the problematic change
3. Settings will be restored to before

## Technical

### What does "Stealth Mode" do?
Stealth Mode identifies and terminates non-essential background processes to free up resources for gaming. It uses a safe list to protect system-critical processes.

### How is the Opta Score calculated?
The score is weighted across three dimensions:
- Performance (40%): FPS potential, stability, load times
- Experience (35%): Visual quality, thermal efficiency, responsiveness
- Competitive (25%): Input lag, network latency, background interference

Each dimension has sub-scores based on hardware specs, applied optimizations, and benchmark results.

### Where are config files stored?
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\com.opta.optimizer`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.opta.optimizer`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.opta.optimizer`

Data files (profiles, history) are in `~/.opta/` on all platforms.
