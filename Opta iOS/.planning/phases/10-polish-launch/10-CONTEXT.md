# Phase 10: Polish, Education & Launch - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Phase 10 is the final push before shipping. It brings together three pillars:

**1. Rock-Solid Stability**
Cross-platform testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux. No crashes, no edge cases. Everything works perfectly regardless of platform.

**2. Educational Depth**
Learn Mode with a quick toggle in the UI - always visible, flip it on/off instantly. When active:
- Comprehensive visual explanations across the board
- Hardware flow diagrams (GPU pipeline, memory hierarchy, thermal throttling)
- Before/after comparisons showing what changed and why
- Impact predictions with animated visualizations before applying

**3. Launch Readiness**
Documentation, polished onboarding, first-time experience that impresses. Everything a new user needs to get started and understand what Opta does.

**Investigation Mode** for power users provides full transparency:
- Show the actual changes (registry keys, config files, exact commands)
- Impact analysis (dependencies, what else this affects, rollback implications)
- Nothing hidden - complete visibility into what Opta is doing under the hood

</vision>

## What Must Be Nailed

All three equally critical - can't ship without all of these being excellent:

- **Stability**: Cross-platform reliability, no crashes, consistent behavior
- **Education**: Learn Mode toggle + visual explanations that truly teach
- **Launch**: Documentation, onboarding, polished first-time experience
- **Transparency**: Investigation Mode with full visibility for power users

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- **Learn Mode Toggle**: Quick toggle always visible in UI (not buried in Settings)
- **Visual Types**:
  - GPU pipeline visualization for resolution/quality settings
  - Memory hierarchy for RAM optimization
  - Thermal throttling visualization
  - Before/after visual diffs
  - Impact prediction animations
- **Investigation Mode**:
  - Registry keys and exact changes
  - Config file modifications
  - System command traces
  - Dependency analysis
  - Rollback steps if something goes wrong

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the final phase before launch. The user emphasized that all aspects are equally critical - stability, education, and launch readiness must all be excellent. No compromises.

The educational features (Learn Mode, Visual Explanations) align with the "Educational Empowerment" pillar from PROJECT.md - "Understand, don't just accept."

Investigation Mode extends the transparency promise - power users get complete visibility into what Opta is doing.
