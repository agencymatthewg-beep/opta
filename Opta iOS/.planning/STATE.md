## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-20)

**Core value:** Capture anything, optimize everything — Photo/prompt → Questions → Beautiful optimized answer
**Current focus:** v1.2 Premium Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 16 (Advanced Gestures)
Plan: 09-01, 09-02, 09-03 complete
Status: Phase 9 COMPLETE
Last activity: 2026-01-21 — Plan 09-03 (Context Menus & Haptics) completed

Progress: █████████░░░░░░░ 56% overall (9 of 16 phases complete)

### v1.2 Premium Polish
| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 9 | Advanced Gestures | Complete |
| 10 | Metal Shaders | Not started |
| 11 | Physics Animations | Not started |
| 12 | Visual Effects | Not started |
| 13 | 3D Transforms | Not started |
| 14 | Motion Design | Not started |
| 15 | Performance Tuning | Not started |

## The One Feature

```
[Photo/Prompt] → [Questions] → [Optimized Answer]
```

Example: Menu photo + "most calories for $10" → Visual recommendation

## Key Differentiators

- **Easy**: Photo + one sentence (not multi-step prompting)
- **Thorough**: "Optamize" slider for depth control
- **Visual**: Cards, rankings, highlights (not text walls)

## Completed Milestones

### v1.1 Polish (Phases 7-8) — Shipped 2026-01-21

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| — | iOS 17+ minimum | Modern SwiftUI features |
| — | Cloud AI (Claude) | Best optimization reasoning |
| — | Photo-first UX | Lowest friction |
| — | Card-based results | Scannable, shareable |
| 1 | OLED background #09090b | Prevents smear on scroll |
| 1 | Spring-only animations | Natural feel |
| 1 | Three-level glass system | Spatial hierarchy |
| 6 | Core Data over SwiftData | Broader compatibility |
| 7 | CoreHaptics with fallback | Premium feel |
| 8 | AppStorage for onboarding | Lightweight persistence |
| 9 | Custom SwipeActionsModifier | Full control over swipe UX |
| 9 | SwipeStateManager singleton | Single-card swipe enforcement |
| 9 | highPriorityGesture for zoom | Pinch takes precedence over scroll |
| 9 | Dynamic pan minimumDistance | Allows scroll at 1x, pan when zoomed |
| 9 | gestureTick at 0.5 intensity | Subtle threshold crossing feedback |
| 9 | Incremental accessibility zoom | 0.5x steps for VoiceOver users |
