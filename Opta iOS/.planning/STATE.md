**Current focus:** v1.2 Premium Polish

### v1.2 Premium Polish
| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 9 | Advanced Gestures | ⏳ Ready to plan |
| 10 | Metal Shaders | Not started |
| 11 | Physics Animations | Not started |
| 12 | Visual Effects | Not started |
| 13 | 3D Transforms | Not started |
| 14 | Motion Design | Not started |

## The One Feature

```
[Photo/Prompt] → [Questions] → [Optimized Answer]
```

Example: Menu photo + "most calories for $10" → Visual recommendation

## Key Differentiators

- **Easy**: Photo + one sentence (not multi-step prompting)
- **Thorough**: "Optamize" slider for depth control
- **Visual**: Cards, rankings, highlights (not text walls)
