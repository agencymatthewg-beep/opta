# Project State: Opta Scan

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-20)

**Core value:** Capture anything, optimize everything — Photo/prompt → Questions → Beautiful optimized answer
**Current focus:** v1.0 MVP — Building the core scan-to-optimization flow

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (App Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: AWAITING HUMAN VERIFICATION
Last activity: 2026-01-20 — Plan 01-02 at checkpoint

Progress: █░░░░░░░░░ 15% of v1.0 (0 of 6 phases complete, 2/2 plans in Phase 1 pending verification)

### v1.0 MVP
| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | App Foundation | In progress (1/2 plans) |
| 2 | Capture Experience | Planned |
| 3 | Claude Integration | Planned |
| 4 | Question Flow | Planned |
| 5 | Result Visualization | Planned |
| 6 | History & Persistence | Planned |

### v1.1 Polish
| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 7 | UX Polish | Future |
| 8 | Launch Prep | Future |

## The One Feature

```
[Photo/Prompt] → [Questions] → [Optimized Answer]
```

Example: Menu photo + "most calories for $10" → Visual recommendation

## Key Differentiators

- **Easy**: Photo + one sentence (not multi-step prompting)
- **Thorough**: "Optamize" slider for depth control
- **Visual**: Cards, rankings, highlights (not text walls)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| — | iOS 17+ minimum | Modern SwiftUI features |
| — | Cloud AI (Claude) | Best optimization reasoning |
| — | Photo-first UX | Lowest friction |
| — | Card-based results | Scannable, shareable |
| 1 | OLED background #09090b | Prevents smear on scroll (not true black) |
| 1 | Spring-only animations | Natural feel per IOS_AESTHETIC_GUIDE |
| 1 | Three-level glass system | Spatial hierarchy (subtle/content/overlay) |
