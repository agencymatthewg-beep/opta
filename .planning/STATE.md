# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-15)

**Core value:** One tool to replace them all — eliminates chaos of multiple conflicting optimizers, detects conflicts, explains optimizations, delivers measurable gains.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Process Management

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 10 (Process Management)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-15 — Completed 03-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ██████░░░░ 28% (8/29 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 2.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 3/3 | 51 min | 17 min |
| 2. Hardware Telemetry | 3/3 | 60 min | 20 min |
| 3. Process Management | 2/2 | 11 min | 5.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3, 44, 6, 5 min
- Trend: Phase 03 very fast - reusing established patterns from Phase 02

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Changed identifier from com.opta.app to com.opta.optimizer | Avoids macOS .app bundle extension conflict |
| 01-02 | CSS variables over CSS-in-JS | Keeps foundation simple, enables easy theme switching |
| 01-02 | State-based routing with useState | Sufficient for MVP with 3 pages, can add router later |
| 01-02 | Neon green accent (#00ff88) | Gaming aesthetic inspired by Discord/GeForce Experience |
| 01-03 | Used official tauri-apps/tauri-action for CI | Well-maintained, consistent cross-platform builds |
| 01-03 | macOS minimum version 10.13 | Balances compatibility with modern features |
| 01-03 | Release profile: LTO + stripping enabled | Smaller, faster production binaries |
| 02-01 | Used uv for package management | Faster, more reliable than pip for Python packages |
| 02-01 | GPUtil as optional dependency | Not all systems have NVIDIA GPUs |
| 02-01 | 3-layer GPU fallback strategy | GPUtil -> pynvml -> macOS system_profiler -> graceful fallback |
| 02-03 | Mock data until 02-02 completes | Allows UI development to proceed independently |
| 02-03 | SVG rings for CPU/GPU meters | Better animation control than CSS-only |
| 02-03 | Color thresholds 60/85% | Standard warning/danger thresholds |
| 02-02 | Subprocess per-request for Python | Simpler than persistent MCP for MVP, can optimize in Phase 10 |
| 02-02 | Nullable telemetry fields | Graceful handling when hardware detection fails |
| 03-01 | 3-second polling for processes | Less frequent than telemetry, reduces system load |
| 03-01 | Top 100 processes limit | Keeps payload manageable, shows most intensive |
| 03-01 | Process categorization patterns | Name + username based for cross-platform compatibility |
| 03-02 | Graceful termination first (0.5s) then force kill | Safer for applications needing cleanup |
| 03-02 | Confirmation modal before termination | Human-in-the-loop safety |
| 03-02 | Auto-dismiss results after 5 seconds | Reduce user friction while showing feedback |
