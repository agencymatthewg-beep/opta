# Phase 08.1 Plan 04: Transparency Panel Summary

**ProfileViewer and DataDeletionModal components with Settings page integration for privacy-first user data transparency**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-16T04:10:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-16T04:15:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created ProfileViewer component displaying preferences, learned patterns, and statistics
- Implemented inline preference editing with save/cancel flow
- Created DataDeletionModal with animated list of what gets deleted
- Integrated transparency panel into Settings page after Privacy section
- Added delete confirmation flow with loading states

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create ProfileViewer component** - `8f8ab85` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create DataDeletionModal component** - `9f61c2b` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Integrate into Settings page** - `c3e6a13` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ProfileViewer.tsx` - Displays user preferences, patterns, stats with edit capability
- `src/components/DataDeletionModal.tsx` - Confirmation dialog for data deletion with animated list
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Added profile section with useUserProfile hook integration

## Decisions Made

- **Inline select elements:** Used native HTML select with glass styling since shadcn Select component wasn't installed - maintains design system compliance while keeping implementation simple
- **Section positioning:** Placed profile section after Privacy section for logical flow (privacy info -> user data control)
- **Type flexibility:** Updated ProfileViewerProps.onUpdate to accept `Promise<UserProfile | void>` for compatibility with useUserProfile hook

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Transparency panel fully functional and integrated
- Users can view all stored profile data
- Users can edit preferences (mode, depth, style)
- Users can delete all data with confirmation
- Ready for pattern learning engine integration (08.1-02)
- Hook into optimization flow to track user choices (08.1-03)
