# [App Name] — iOS Platform Profile

> Quick Draw. Convenient. Efficient. One hand, one thumb, done.

---

## iOS Philosophy

This is the **focused** version. Core functionality optimised for:
- Small screen (6.1-6.9" phone, 11-13" iPad)
- Touch + gesture input (one-handed use)
- Siri and Shortcuts integration
- Glanceable information (widgets, Live Activities)
- Intermittent use (quick check, respond, leave)

**Design rule:** If it takes more than 2 taps to do the most common task, redesign it. iOS users are one-handed on a train.

## iOS-Exclusive Features

| # | Feature | Why Mobile-Only |
|---|---------|----------------|
<!-- OPIS: Siri Intents, Widgets, Live Activities, Share Sheet, etc. -->

## Simplified Features (Shared but Streamlined)

| Feature | macOS Version | iOS Simplification |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
<!-- OPIS: Features that exist on both but are simpler/focused on iOS -->

## UX Patterns

### Navigation
- **Tab bar** for primary navigation (bottom, thumb-reachable)
- **Swipe gestures** for switching contexts (swipe between bots, swipe to delete)
- **Pull-to-refresh** for manual sync
- **Long-press** for contextual options (replaces right-click)
- **Back swipe** (edge gesture) for navigation stack

### Thumb Zone Design
```
┌──────────────────┐
│                  │  ← Stretch zone (status, title)
│                  │
│   NATURAL ZONE   │  ← Content (scrollable)
│                  │
│   PRIMARY ACTS   │  ← Thumb zone (main actions)
├──────────────────┤
│    TAB BAR       │  ← Navigation
└──────────────────┘
```

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Level 1:** Summary/preview (list view, cards)
- **Level 2:** Detail (tap to expand, full content)
- **Level 3:** Advanced (tap "More", settings, debug)

### Gesture Map
| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
<!-- OPIS: From Stage 3 iOS questions -->

### Haptics
- Light tap: selection feedback
- Medium tap: action confirmation
- Heavy tap: destructive action warning

## iOS-Specific Non-Negotiables

| # | Requirement | Reasoning |
|---|------------|-----------|
<!-- OPIS: Requirements that only apply to iOS -->

## iOS Anti-Features (Never Build)

<!-- OPIS: Things explicitly excluded from iOS version — complexity that belongs on macOS -->

## iOS-Specific Integrations

- [ ] Siri Intents (list specific intents)
- [ ] Siri Shortcuts (automation flows)
- [ ] Lock Screen Widgets (glanceable info)
