# [Project Name] — Development Workflows

> How to build, test, deploy, and delegate work on this project.

---

## Build

```bash
# Development build
<!-- OPIS: Project-specific build commands -->

# Production build
<!-- OPIS: Project-specific production build -->

# Clean build
<!-- OPIS: Clean + rebuild commands -->
```

## Test

```bash
# Run all tests
<!-- OPIS: Test commands -->

# Run specific test
<!-- OPIS: Single test commands -->
```

**What must pass before merge:**
<!-- OPIS: From GUARDRAILS.md testing section -->

## Deploy

<!-- OPIS: Deployment process from Stage 3 answers -->

## Clauding Workflow (This Project)

**Reference:** `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2H-Workflows/CLAUDING.md`

### When to Use Clauding
- Complex features (3+ files, architectural changes)
- Refactoring across multiple modules
- New subsystem implementation

### Context Files for Claude Code
When delegating to Claude Code, provide these files:
1. `APP.md` — Project identity
2. `CLAUDE.md` — Coding rules
3. `docs/GUARDRAILS.md` — What not to do
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System structure
5. The specific task file (from tasks/ or docs/)

### Prompt Template
```xml
<context>
Read these files first:
- APP.md (project identity)
- CLAUDE.md (coding rules)
- docs/GUARDRAILS.md (hard limits)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
</context>

<task>
[Specific task description]
</task>

<constraints>
- Follow patterns in CLAUDE.md
- Don't violate any GUARDRAILS.md rules
- Record any decisions in docs/DECISIONS.md
</constraints>

<output>
- Implement the changes
- Update docs/CHANGELOG.md
- Run tests: [test commands]
</output>
```

## Sub-Agent Delegation

### Research Tasks
- **Model:** Sonnet (cost-effective for research)
- **Output:** `docs/research/` folder
- **Pattern:** `sessions_spawn` with specific research brief

### Implementation Tasks
- **Model:** Opus or Claude Code
- **Pattern:** Clauding workflow with context files
- **Isolation:** Git branch per feature

### Review Tasks
- **Model:** Opus (quality gate)
- **Input:** Diff + GUARDRAILS.md + CLAUDE.md
- **Output:** Approve/request changes with reasoning

## Agent Team Patterns

**Reference:** `AIALL/agents/claude-code-agent-teams-production.md`

<!-- OPIS: Project-specific team compositions per ROADMAP.md phase -->

### Implementation Team Template
```
Lead (Opus) — Architecture + coordination
├── Worker 1 (Sonnet) — [Module A]
├── Worker 2 (Sonnet) — [Module B]
└── Worker 3 (Sonnet) — Testing
```

## Overnight Automation

**Reference:** `AIALL/workflows/autonomous-sleep-to-ship-pipeline.md`

### Tasks Safe for Overnight
<!-- OPIS: List of task types that can run autonomously -->

### Tasks Requiring Matthew
<!-- OPIS: List of tasks that need human approval -->

### Quality Gates
<!-- OPIS: What must pass before auto-merge -->

## Fix Logging (Mandatory)

**Reference:** `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2D-Fix-Logs/`

When a bug fix requires >1 attempt OR causes downtime:
1. Create `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2D-Fix-Logs/YYYY-MM-DD-[project]-[issue-slug].md`
2. Use template: `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2D-Fix-Logs/templates/FIX-TEMPLATE.md`
3. Update `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2D-Fix-Logs/INDEX.md`
4. Cross-reference in this project's `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Cross-Bot Communication

When this project's work affects other bots or projects:
1. Create `~/Documents/AI26/AIALL/inbox/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-from-[bot].md`
2. Include: what changed, why, how to use it, action items per bot
