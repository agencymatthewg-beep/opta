## Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Before researching anything** → check this file first. The answer may already exist.
2. **Before implementing a pattern** → check AIALL/workflows/ and AIALL/agents/ for proven approaches.
3. **After discovering something useful** → add it here AND create an AIALL inbox doc for cross-bot distribution.
4. **When stuck on a bug** → search `~/Synced/AI26/2-Bot-Ops/2D-Fix-Logs/INDEX.md` for similar issues.
5. **When adding a new integration** → check AIALL/MCPS/ for existing MCP servers before building custom.
6. **For credential access** → NEVER hardcode. Read from `~/Synced/AI26/1-SOT/1C-Accounts/MASTER-KEYS.md`.
