# Opta

**One tool to rule them all.** Opta is an AI-powered PC optimization orchestrator that replaces the chaos of multiple conflicting optimizers with a single, intelligent system.

## Why Opta?

Most gamers run 3-5 optimization tools (GeForce Experience, Razer Cortex, MSI Afterburner, etc.) that conflict with each other, create confusion, and often do more harm than good. Opta:

- **Detects conflicts** between optimization tools and warns you
- **Explains every change** so you understand what's happening
- **Learns your preferences** and adapts recommendations over time
- **Measures results** with before/after benchmarking

## Features

### Game Optimization
- Auto-detect installed games across Steam, Epic, GOG
- Apply community-verified optimal settings
- Before/after benchmarking to prove gains

### Hardware Telemetry
- Real-time CPU, GPU, RAM monitoring
- Temperature and utilization tracking
- Process management with "Stealth Mode"

### AI-Powered Assistance
- Local LLM for privacy-first, instant responses
- Cloud AI for complex optimization strategies
- Context-aware recommendations based on your hardware

### Optimization Score
- Three-dimensional scoring: Performance, Experience, Competitive
- Compare with friends and global leaderboards
- Track improvement over time
