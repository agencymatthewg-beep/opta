# /aideas - Advanced Ideas Generator

Generate power-user ideas with deep customization, AI integration, and advanced capabilities.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the current conversation context
2. Identify features or areas being discussed
3. Generate **advanced** ideas targeting power users:
   - Deep customization options
   - AI/LLM integration possibilities
   - Automation and scripting hooks
   - API extensibility
   - Advanced configuration
   - Power-user workflows

## Idea Philosophy

For each basic concept, elevate it to power-user level:

| Basic Idea | Advanced Idea |
|------------|---------------|
| System themes | AI-driven theme generation from prompts, CSS variable exposure, theme sharing/import |
| Notifications | Rule-based notification engine, webhook integrations, custom triggers |
| Dashboard layout | Drag-drop with grid snapping, layout presets, shareable configurations |
| Search | Regex support, saved queries, query language, AI semantic search |
| Process filters | Filter expressions, combinable logic, saveable filter sets |
| Reports | Template builder, scheduled generation, custom data sources |
