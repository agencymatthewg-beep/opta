# Opta Local Web — Platform Manifest

> The browser-based dashboard and chat client for Opta LMX.

---

## Platform Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Stack | Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript |
| UI | @opta/ui + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion |
| Build | `next build` (static export for Vercel) |
| Target | Chrome 120+, Safari 17+, Firefox 120+ |
| Responsive | Desktop-first, tablet-responsive |

## UX Philosophy

**"Command Center"** — Information density prioritized. Multi-panel layouts, sidebars, real-time gauges. The web app is where you go to see everything at once.

- Dashboard shows all metrics simultaneously (no tab switching)
- Chat panel can live alongside dashboard (split view on wide screens)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Full drag-and-drop for model routing and RAG ingestion

## Feature Set

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- [ ] Manual server connection (IP + port + admin key)
- [ ] Basic streaming chat with model selection
- [ ] Chat history (local storage, then LMX Session API)
- [ ] Responsive layout with glass panel system

### Phase 2 — Dashboard
- [ ] Real-time VRAM gauge (SSE from `/admin/events`)
- [ ] Loaded models list with one-click unload
- [ ] Model browser with VRAM estimation and load button
- [ ] Throughput metrics (tokens/sec chart)
- [ ] Server temperature and uptime

### Phase 3 — Anywhere
- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel URL configuration
- [ ] Connection status indicator (LAN green / WAN amber / offline red)
- [ ] Automatic LAN-to-WAN failover

### Phase 4 — Sessions
- [ ] Session list from LMX Session API

### Later Phases
