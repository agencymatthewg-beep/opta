# Operation ANE — Current State

**Phase:** Pre-Phase 0 (Planning)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** Research complete, implementation not started

## Completed
- [x] Full ANE performance research (ANEMLL-bench data, Apple research, community findings)
- [x] Architecture design for ANE context engine
- [x] Custom model fleet specification (6 models)
- [x] LMX integration points identified
- [x] Documentation structure created

## Next Actions
1. Run ANEMLL-bench on M3 Ultra
2. Convert first embedding model to CoreML
3. Verify ANE placement

## Blockers
- Claude Code not authenticated on Mono512 (needs `claude login`)
- M3 Ultra ANE bandwidth unknown (needs benchmarking)
