# Opta Local Product Model (Canonical)

Last updated: 2026-03-01
Owner: Opta Local

## Core Product Definition

Opta Local consists of **3 core apps**:

1. **Opta CLI**
   - Terminal-first control surface for chat, tasks, and orchestration.
2. **Opta LMX + Dashboard**
   - Local inference engine (LMX) plus its dashboard experience.
3. **Opta Code Desktop (macOS + Windows)**
   - Desktop application surface for session and workflow control.

## Surface Websites (Discovery / Navigation)

These are **web surfaces**, not core product apps:

- **optalocal.com** (Opta Home): brand + ecosystem landing
- **init.optalocal.com** (Opta Init): onboarding/install landing
- **help.optalocal.com** (Opta Help): documentation landing
- **accounts.optalocal.com** (Opta Accounts): identity, keys, account settings

## Taxonomy Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Do not label surface websites as core apps.
2. "Your Opta Apps" sections must list only the 3 core apps.
3. Technical architecture terms (daemon, web dashboard internals) are not product taxonomy.
4. If a page needs both views, split into:
   - **Product taxonomy** (what users buy/use)
   - **Architecture** (how it works internally)

## Approved One-Line Copy

- **Opta CLI** — "Terminal-first control for the Opta Local stack."
- **Opta LMX + Dashboard** — "Local inference engine with a real-time dashboard."
- **Opta Code Desktop** — "Desktop app for Opta workflows on macOS and Windows."
