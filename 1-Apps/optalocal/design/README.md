# Opta Design & Brand System

This folder is the dedicated location for documenting aesthetics, relationships, and storing official logos for **Opta** and its sub-ecosystems.

## Brand Hierarchy Context

*   **Opta / Opta AI (Opta Operations):** The top-level business entity. This encompasses all products, including broader optimizing apps (like Life Manager).
*   **Opta Local:** A specific sub-ecosystem of Opta dedicated *solely* to local LLM (Large Language Model) applications. It helps users run, manage, and utilize local AI models.

### The Opta Local Ecosystem Breakdown

**1. Main Local Apps (The Core Product)**
These are the core applications that directly handle the execution and utilization of local LLMs on the user's machine:
*   **Opta CLI**
*   **Opta Code** (Desktop)
*   **Opta LMX** (The inference engine) & **Opta Local** (Its management dashboard)

**2. Opta Management Websites (Support & Infrastructure)**
These web properties and services exist to assist, distribute, and manage the main Opta Local apps:
*   **Opta Accounts**
*   **Opta Status**
*   **Opta Home** (optalocal.com)
*   **Opta Help**
*   **Opta Learn**
*   **Opta Init**

## Structure

*   **/logos/**: The single source of truth for all official SVG and PNG brand marks for Opta overall, the Opta Local sub-ecosystem, and each individual app/website.
*   **/aesthetics/**: Documentation breaking down how the Opta design system applies to different apps, highlighting shared traits and app-specific variations based on their role (Core App vs Management Website).
*   **/relationships/**: Architectural and user-flow diagrams/documentation explaining how the different apps interact, and the hierarchy between Opta AI and Opta Local.

> **Note:** The root `OPTA-AESTHETIC-CONTEXT.md` file provides the core Gemini injection document for the global design rules (colors, typography, spacing). The documents within this `/design` folder expand upon those rules to show cross-app implementation details within the business hierarchy.
