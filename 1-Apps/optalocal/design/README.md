# Opta Local Design & Brand System

This folder is the dedicated location for documenting the Opta Local ecosystem's aesthetics, relationships, and storing official logos.

## Structure

- **/logos/**: The single source of truth for all official SVG and PNG brand marks for Optalocal overall and each individual app/website.
- **/aesthetics/**: Documentation breaking down how the Opta Local design system applies to different apps, highlighting shared traits and app-specific variations (e.g. CLI vs Web vs Desktop).
- **/relationships/**: Architectural and user-flow diagrams/documentation explaining how the different apps interact and support each other.

> **Note:** The root `OPTA-AESTHETIC-CONTEXT.md` file provides the core Gemini injection document for the global design rules (colors, typography, spacing). The documents within this `/design` folder expand upon those rules to show cross-app implementation details.
