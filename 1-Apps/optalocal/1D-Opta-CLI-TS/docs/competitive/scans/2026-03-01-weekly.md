# Weekly Competitive Scan — 2026-03-01

## Sources checked
- `gh release list` + latest release notes:
  - anthropics/claude-code (v2.1.63)
  - anomalyco/opencode (v1.2.15)
  - MoonshotAI/kimi-cli (1.16.0)
  - Aider-AI/aider (v0.86.0)
  - google-gemini/gemini-cli (v0.31.0)
- Web search:
  - "AI coding CLI new features 2026"
  - "Claude Code update"
  - "OpenCode update"

## Notable deltas (new/important)
1. **JSON output is now explicit in Gemini CLI** (`-o/--output-format json`) → moves JSON output toward industry standard.
2. **Claude Code added HTTP hooks** (POST JSON callbacks) and expanded slash command automation (`/batch`, `/simplify`).
3. **Gemini CLI added RuntimeHook functions** and strengthened Plan Mode + policy constraints.
4. **Kimi CLI added multi-root workspace context** (`--add-dir` and `/add-dir`).
5. **Plan mode is now clearly present across OpenCode/Kimi/Gemini**.

## Matrix changes made
Updated: `docs/competitive/COMPETITIVE-MATRIX.md`
- Updated row 27 (JSON output): Gemini marked ✅, gap score raised to 3 (HIGH).
- Updated row 37 (Hooks/lifecycle): Gemini marked ✅ RuntimeHook.
- Added row 43: Multi-root workspace context.
- Added row 44: HTTP hooks / webhook callbacks.
- Added row 45: Plan mode (read-only planning).
- Updated scan history and summary counts.

## Auto-generated tasks (gap_score >= 3, estimated <200 LOC)
Created:
- `tasks/plans/auto-json-output.md`
- `tasks/plans/auto-http-hooks.md`

## Competitive risk snapshot
- **Immediate pressure:** JSON output and hook/webhook support are converging into baseline CLI expectations.
- **Strategic pressure:** Plan mode and multi-root context improve reliability in large repos and reduce failure loops.
- **Current Opta moat still intact:** local model operations + health + routing are still differentiated.

## Next recommendation
- Execute `auto-json-output` first (highest ROI, low risk, fast).
- Then execute `auto-http-hooks` with strict redaction defaults.
