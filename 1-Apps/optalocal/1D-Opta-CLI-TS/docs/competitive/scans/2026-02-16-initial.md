**Type:** Initial scan + baseline establishment
**Scanner:** Opta Max

## Competitor Versions (as of scan)

| CLI | Latest Version | Notable Recent Change |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|
| Claude Code | 2.1.42 | Opus 4.6 model, Agent Teams stable, skills from --add-dir, heredoc fix |
| OpenCode | ~0.3.x (rapid releases) | Desktop app (Tauri), 104K stars, renamed from SST/opencode → anomalyco/opencode → now "Crush" by Charm |
| Kimi Code | K2.5 release | Agent Swarm (100 sub-agents), vision-to-code, 256K context |
| Aider | v0.75+ | Tree-sitter integration, auto-commit per edit |
| Gemini CLI | 1.x | Google Search integration, async tool execution |

## Key Findings

### ⚠️ OpenCode Rebranding Alert
OpenCode (opencode-ai/opencode) has been **ARCHIVED**. The project continued as **Crush** by Charmbracelet (github.com/charmbracelet/crush). The anomalyco/opencode fork is the one with 104K stars and active development. Two separate projects with similar names — track anomalyco version.

### New Features Detected (not in our matrix yet)
1. **Desktop app** (OpenCode/Crush) — Tauri-based desktop wrapper. Not relevant for CLI comparison but shows expansion.
2. **Skills from --add-dir** (Claude Code) — Auto-loads skills from additional directories. Strengthens their project awareness.
3. **OpenCode /connect command** — Built-in API key management via web auth flow.

### No New Features That Change Our Priorities
The CRITICAL gaps remain:
1. Sub-agents (Claude Teams, Kimi Swarm)
2. MCP protocol support
