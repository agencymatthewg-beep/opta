# Research Artifacts Archive

This directory stores generated research artifacts that were previously kept at
the project root (`gu-*.html` and legacy analysis reports).

Why this exists:
- keeps the repository root focused on source/config files
- preserves historical research outputs for reference
- provides a stable home for links from planning docs

Contents:
- `ANALYSIS-REPORT.md`
- all `gu-*.html` generated visual artifacts
- `2026-02-23-speculative-readiness-matrix.json` (live benchmark matrix output)
- `2026-02-23-speculative-readiness-scorecard.md` (live readiness verdict + rollout gates)
