# Opta Local iOS — Roadmap

> iOS platform development phases. Begins after Web Phase 1 establishes API patterns.

---

## Current Phase: Deferred (Web First)

iOS delivery is intentionally paused while the web app is stabilized for daily use and deployment readiness. Resume iOS implementation after web quality gates and docs are fully stable.
