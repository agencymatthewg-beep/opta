# Phase 41: Knowledge Research Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This phase creates the mathematical foundation that powers the Configuration Calculator in Phase 47. The goal is building rich knowledge documents with real performance curves — actual numerical relationships between hardware, settings, and outcomes.

Gemini operates as an **autonomous researcher**. I kick off a topic, Gemini does deep exploration guided by its own knowledge graph, and delivers comprehensive documents. The research is framed around actionability: "what can we actually optimize" — not academic concepts, but measurable impacts.

The focus is **Apple Silicon mastery first**. Go extremely deep on M1/M2/M3/M4 architecture before touching Windows/PC hardware. Make macOS optimization world-class. This means understanding Metal shaders, unified memory, efficiency cores, thermal profiles — everything that makes Apple Silicon unique.

Research sessions mix approaches: deep dives on architecture, comparative analysis between platforms, and quantitative extraction of real numbers. But the common thread is always: how does this translate to optimization decisions?

Validation happens later when building the calculator. Phase 41 is pure research — comprehensive knowledge capture that will be tested against real hardware predictions downstream.

## What Must Be Nailed

All three domains equally important for the calculator to work:

- **Hardware-specific data** — Know exactly how M3 Pro differs from M3 Max differs from M2 Ultra. Real numbers per hardware generation.
- **Setting impact precision** — Quantify exactly what each setting does to FPS, VRAM, thermals. Measurable relationships, not guesses.
- **Cross-domain interactions** — Understand how GPU, CPU, memory, and thermals affect each other. The system as a whole, not isolated components.

## Specific Ideas

- **Output format:** Rich markdown knowledge documents with tables, formulas, and explanations. These get embedded into prompts and inform the calculator's logic.
- **Research style:** Let Gemini explore — trust the model's knowledge graph to surface what's important. Don't over-constrain with templates.
- **Guardrail:** Everything framed as "what can we optimize" — optimization-focused, not academic. Actionable knowledge.
- **Scope:** Apple Silicon mastery before breadth. Depth over coverage.

## Additional Context

The 5 plans in the roadmap (GPU, CPU, memory, thermal/power, storage) should be reframed around Apple Silicon depth rather than cross-platform breadth. The priority is making macOS optimization exceptional.

This phase feeds directly into:
- Phase 42: Hardware Synergy Database
- Phase 44: macOS Optimization Core
- Phase 47: Configuration Calculator

The research-to-calculator pipeline: Research → Predictions → Test against real hardware → Refine. But validation is out of scope for Phase 41 — that comes when building the calculator.
