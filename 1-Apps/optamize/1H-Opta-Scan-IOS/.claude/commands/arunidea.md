# /arunidea - Advanced Idea Pipeline

Run full 3-stage idea pipeline with power-user focus: AI integration, extensibility, and advanced customization.

## Philosophy

This is `/runidea` elevated for power users. Every idea should consider:
- **AI Integration** - How can LLMs enhance this?
- **Extensibility** - Can users build on top of it?
- **Automation** - Is it scriptable, schedulable, triggerable?
- **Customization** - How deep can users configure it?
- **API Surface** - What hooks and endpoints does it expose?

## Stages

### Stage 1: Advanced Ideation
- Deep analysis with power-user lens
- Generate 15-25+ ideas with extensibility focus
- Each idea considers AI enhancement potential
- Filter to top candidates based on customization depth

### Stage 2: Power-User Critique
- Evaluate extensibility and API potential
- Assess AI integration opportunities
- Score automation and scripting potential
- Consider advanced user workflows

### Stage 3: Compare & Architect
- Comparison matrix with advanced dimensions
- Architecture sketches for top ideas
- Extensibility patterns and integration points
- Concrete power-user scenarios

## Usage

```
/arunidea [topic or problem]
```

## Example

```
/arunidea How should Opta handle process automation rules?
```

## Output Format

## Stage 1: Advanced Ideation

**Problem Analysis (Power-User Lens):**
[Analysis focusing on customization needs, automation potential, integration requirements]

**Advanced Ideas:**
1. **[Idea]** - [Description]
   - AI Potential: [How AI could enhance]
   - Extensibility: [What users could build on top]
   - Automation: [Scriptable/schedulable aspects]

2. ...
(15-25+ ideas)

**Shortlist for Critique:** [Top 3-5 with highest power-user potential]

---
## Stage 2: Power-User Critique

**Idea 1: [Name]**
- **Extensibility Score:** X/10 - [Can users extend, customize, build on it?]
- **AI Enhancement Score:** X/10 - [How much can AI elevate this?]
- **Automation Score:** X/10 - [Scriptable, schedulable, triggerable?]
- **Customization Depth:** X/10 - [How configurable for advanced users?]
- **Implementation Complexity:** Low/Medium/High
- **Power-User Appeal:** [Why advanced users would want this]
- **Risks:** [Technical and adoption risks]
- **Overall Score:** X/10

[Repeat for shortlisted ideas]

## Stage 3: Compare & Architect

**Comparison Matrix:**

| Dimension | Idea 1 | Idea 2 | Idea 3 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Extensibility | Low/Med/High | ... | ... |
| AI Integration | Low/Med/High | ... | ... |
| Automation Potential | Low/Med/High | ... | ... |
| Customization Depth | Low/Med/High | ... | ... |
| API Surface Area | Minimal/Moderate/Rich | ... | ... |
| Implementation Effort | Low/Med/High | ... | ... |

**Architecture Sketches:**

### Idea 1: [Name]

**Core Components:**
- [Component 1] - [Purpose]
- [Component 2] - [Purpose]

**Extension Points:**
- [Hook/API 1] - [What users can do with it]
- [Hook/API 2] - [What users can do with it]

**AI Integration Layer:**
- [How AI plugs in]
- [What AI enhances]

**Automation Hooks:**
- [Trigger points]
- [Scriptable operations]

### Idea 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

**Power-User Scenarios:**

### Scenario A: [Advanced use case]
**User Profile:** [Type of power user]
**Workflow:** [Step-by-step of advanced usage]
**Customizations Applied:** [What they configured]
**AI Assistance:** [How AI helped]
**Outcome:** [Value gained]

### Scenario B: [Different advanced use case]
[Same structure]

**Recommendation:**
[Which idea(s) offer the deepest power-user value, with reasoning about extensibility and AI potential]
```

## Opta-Specific Advanced Dimensions

Evaluate ideas against:
- **MCP Compatibility**: Can this be exposed via MCP tools?
- **Hybrid Router Fit**: Does this benefit from local vs cloud AI?
- **Tauri Integration**: Rust backend opportunities?
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Equal power on all platforms?
- **Design System Alignment**: Premium feel maintained?

- `/cone` - Wild creative exploration

## Notes

- Most advanced ideation command
- Use for features targeting power users
- Stage 2 evaluates extensibility over simplicity
- Stage 3 includes architecture, not just comparison
- For standard users, use `/runidea`
- For quick power-user ideas, use `/aideas`
