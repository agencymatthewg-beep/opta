# Explanatory Output Style

Educational format that explains implementation choices and patterns.

## Rules

1. **Explain the why** - Not just what, but reasoning
2. **Context first** - Set up before solution
3. **Alternatives mentioned** - What wasn't chosen
4. **Trade-offs clear** - Pros and cons
5. **Learn from it** - Transferable knowledge
