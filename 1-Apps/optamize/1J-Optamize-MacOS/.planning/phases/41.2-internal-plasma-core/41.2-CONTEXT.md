# Phase 41.2: Internal Plasma Core - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for research

## How This Should Work

Swirling energy clouds inside the ring — like purple nebula slowly churning within the glass. The effect should feel like barely-contained power held within the ring, creating visual tension and restrained energy.

The plasma undergoes a full transformation based on energy level:
- **Dormant (0%)**: Subtle but present — the ring is never truly "off". Dark, very slow movement. Sleeping power visible if you look.
- **Active (50%)**: Vibrant purple, moderate swirl speed. The "sweet spot" matching 50%Opta.png.
- **Max (100%)**: Intense bright violet/white, rapid churning. Unleashed energy.

The movement should feel **slow and hypnotic** — meditative quality, like a lava lamp or slow nebula. Something you could watch for hours.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Organic movement** — Must feel alive and natural, not mechanical or patterned
- **Depth illusion** — Must look like it's truly INSIDE the glass, not painted on the surface
- **Energy storytelling** — Must instantly communicate the ring's energy state at a glance

All three are equally essential. The effect fails if any one is missing.

## Specific Ideas

- **Primary reference**: 50%Opta.png is the north star target
- **Contained energy feel**: Like a reactor core barely containing its power
- **Color transformation**: Dark purple (dormant) → vibrant purple (active) → bright violet/white (max)
- **Speed transformation**: Very slow churning (dormant) → moderate swirl (active) → rapid churning (max)
- **Never fully off**: Even at 0% energy, subtle plasma should be visible — sleeping, not dead

## Additional Context

This is identified as the most critical missing element from the current 3D ring implementation. The reference images (0%Opta.png, 50%Opta.png) show internal plasma that the current shader doesn't have.

The existing glassmorphism shader has fresnel rim lighting and energy glow, but no internal volumetric effect. This phase adds the "soul" inside the glass shell.
