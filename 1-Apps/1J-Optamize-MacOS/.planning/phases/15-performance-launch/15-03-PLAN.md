# Opta v1.1 Release Notes

## macOS Refinement Release

This release focuses on polishing the macOS experience with new core features,
improved UX, and stability enhancements.

### Highlights

#### Opta Text Zone
A new central status area that keeps you informed about what's happening.
Color-coded feedback, animated indicators, and contextual hints make it
easy to understand Opta's state at a glance.

#### Pinpoint Optimization
New wizard-style optimization for when you want to focus on a single goal.
"Maximize FPS in Valorant" walks you through every relevant setting with
predicted impact for each change.

#### Learning Transparency
Opta now shows you exactly what it has learned about your preferences.
View, edit, or delete any learned preference. See monthly summaries of
what Opta discovered about your optimization style.

#### Smart Rollback
Every optimization creates a rollback point. If something doesn't work,
one click undoes all changes. Opta even auto-detects performance drops
and offers to roll back automatically.
