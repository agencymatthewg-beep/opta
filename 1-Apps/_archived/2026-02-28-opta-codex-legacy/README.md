# Opta Codex Legacy Archive (Staging)

Created: 2026-02-28
Purpose: Temporary archive staging for legacy "Opta Codex" naming/assets while transitioning fully to **Opta Code**.

Current policy:
- Canonical app: `1-Apps/optalocal/1P-Opta-Code-Desktop`
- Legacy Codex paths remain as compatibility aliases for now.
- Do not develop new features under Codex naming.

Planned next step:
- Remove Codex aliases after transition window and script/path validation.
