# Optamize Website — 3 Design Options

Created overnight, Feb 13 2026. Pick your favourite, Matthew.

## Option A — "Brutalist Precision"
**File:** `index-option-a.html` | **Screenshot:** `optamize-option-a.png`

**Vibe:** Terminal meets luxury. Engineering blueprint aesthetic.

**What makes it unique:**
- **No rounded corners anywhere** — every element is sharp, deliberate
- **Space Mono + Space Grotesk** font pairing — monospace accents give it a developer/engineering feel
- **Grid overlay** — subtle blueprint-style background grid
- **Asymmetric hero** — split layout with text left, ring right (not the typical centered hero)
- **Status bar** — engineering-style ticker strip below hero ("Systems Online", "Zero Telemetry")
- **Table-row app cards** — apps displayed as structured data rows, not floating cards
- **Section numbering** — large faded "01", "02" markers
- **Corner brackets** around the ring — technical framing
- **Offset hover shadows** — brutal 4px box-shadow on buttons instead of glows
- **Feature grid cells** — bordered cells like a technical spec sheet

**Best for:** Standing out from every other SaaS landing page. Memorable. Polarizing (in a good way).

## Option B — "Organic Flow"
**File:** `index-option-b.html` | **Screenshot:** `optamize-option-b.png`

**Vibe:** Stripe meets Notion. Warm, tactile, alive.

**What makes it unique:**
- **Film grain overlay** — subtle SVG noise texture across entire page
- **Morphing blob shapes** — organic background blobs that shift and morph (CSS animation)
- **Mouse parallax** — blobs respond to cursor movement for depth
- **Warm color accents** — rose pink (#f472b6) mixed with purple, multi-color gradient on headlines
- **Inter + DM Sans** — clean but with warmth
- **Gradient top-bar on cards** — hover reveals a purple→pink gradient accent line
- **Wavy SVG divider** — organic wave shape between sections
- **Glowing dot features** — purple dots with glow as list markers
- **Shimmer CTA button** — light sweep animation on hover
- **Gradient section rules** — thin dividers that fade from transparent to purple

**Best for:** Feeling premium and approachable at the same time. The most "human touch" of the three.

## Option C — "Editorial Premium"
**File:** `index-option-c.html` | **Screenshot:** `optamize-option-c.png`

**Vibe:** Apple Newsroom meets Linear. Magazine sophistication.

**What makes it unique:**
- **Instrument Serif headlines** — large, elegant serif typography (italic accents)
- **Magazine-style layout** — two-column editorial grid for apps section
- **Generous whitespace** — the most restrained and spacious of all three
- **Minimal decoration** — no glows, no gradients on buttons. Thin borders, thin lines
- **Italic accent words** — "One *beautiful* tool" — editorial typographic flourish
- **Thin horizontal rules** — classic editorial dividers between sections
- **Numbered entries** — large serif numbers (01, 02, 03) for each app
- **Two paragraphs per app** — more narrative copy, like a magazine article
- **Outline-only buttons** — ghost buttons with subtle purple border
- **Small accent lines** — 32px purple lines above each feature

**Best for:** Looking expensive, sophisticated, and like a real design agency made it. The most "un-AI" feeling.

## Quick Comparison

| | A: Brutalist | B: Organic | C: Editorial |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feel | Raw, technical | Warm, alive | Sophisticated, restrained |
| Fonts | Space Mono/Grotesk | Inter/DM Sans | Instrument Serif/Inter |
| Hero layout | Split (text + ring) | Centered | Centered |
| Cards | Table rows | Rounded cards | Editorial columns |
| Personality | Engineer | Designer | Editor |
| Risk level | High (polarizing) | Medium (safe-unique) | Low (universally premium) |

## My Recommendation

**Option C** feels the most "human designer" and hardest to clock as AI-generated. The serif typography and editorial spacing are things AI templates almost never do.

**Option A** is the most memorable and brand-differentiating — nobody in the app space looks like this.

**Option B** is the safest upgrade — clearly better than the current site with the most polish and micro-interactions.

Pick based on how bold you want to be. 🤙
