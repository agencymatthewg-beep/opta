# Optamize Taglines

## Main Brand — Optamize

| # | Tagline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Less noise. More machine.** | Captures the core value (removing bloat) with a rhythm that sticks. "Machine" reclaims the word from cold/corporate — your Mac IS a machine, let it act like one. |
| 2 | **Built by one. Used by thousands.** | Leans into the indie-dev story. Authenticity is the brand's unfair advantage over faceless companies. |
| 3 | **Your tech, minus the bullshit.** | Bold, opinionated, memorable. Might be too edgy for App Store but perfect for the website/social. |
| 4 | **Software that gets out of the way.** | Positions Optamize as the anti-bloat brand. Paradox: the best optimizer is one you forget is running. |
| 5 | **Fast things, done well.** | Riffs on the maker ethos ("slow things done well") but flips it — we're about speed AND quality. |
| 6 | **Dial it in.** | Short, active, verb-first. Feels like tuning an instrument or a race car. Implies precision. |
| 7 | **No fluff. Just results.** | Direct, confident. Works as a tagline and a brand promise. |
| 8 | **Tools for people who notice the difference.** | Targets the quality-conscious user. Flatters the audience without being sycophantic. |
| 9 | **One dev. Four apps. Zero bloat.** | Structural rhythm. Tells the story in six words. |
| 10 | **Make it work like it should.** | Taps into the frustration that things DON'T work like they should. Positions Optamize as the fix. |

**Top picks for primary use:** #1, #6, or #10 (versatile, concise, strong).

## Opta (macOS Optimizer)

| # | Tagline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Your Mac, but faster.** | Dead simple. Promises exactly what it delivers. No interpretation needed. |
| 2 | **One click. Clean machine.** | Action + result. The alliteration is subtle enough to not feel cheesy. |
| 3 | **The tune-up your Mac's been asking for.** | Personifies the Mac slightly — relatable, warm. |
| 4 | **Strip it back. Speed it up.** | Two actions, clear cause-and-effect. Active voice. |
| 5 | **Reclaim every byte.** | Specific, technical enough to feel credible, but still accessible. |

## Opta Scan (iOS Scanner)

| # | Tagline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Point. Scan. Know.** | Three beats, escalating value. Mimics the actual user flow. |
| 2 | **Your pocket analyst.** | Positions the phone as a tool, not a toy. "Analyst" > "assistant." |
| 3 | **See what others miss.** | Aspirational without being grandiose. Implies the scan reveals hidden info. |
| 4 | **Answers at arm's length.** | Physical metaphor — your phone is literally at arm's length. Grounded, clever. |
| 5 | **Scan it. Sorted.** | Australian-inflected casual. Feels like Matt's voice. Fast and done. |

## Opta Life (Web + iOS — Task/Life Management)

| # | Tagline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Do less. Finish more.** | Counterintuitive hook — not about adding tasks, about focusing on what matters. |
| 2 | **Your day, defragged.** | Tech metaphor applied to life. Nerdy but accessible. Ties back to the optimization brand. |
| 3 | **Structure without the straitjacket.** | Addresses the fear that productivity tools are rigid. Opta Life is flexible. |
| 4 | **The list that actually works.** | Acknowledges that most to-do apps fail. Confident, simple. |
| 5 | **Get your shit together.** (alt: **Get it together.**) | Irreverent, honest, the thing you say to yourself. The clean version works too. |

## AICompare

| # | Tagline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Every model. One honest answer.** | Positions AICompare as the unbiased referee. "Honest" is the key word. |
| 2 | **Stop guessing which one's better.** | Speaks to the user's actual frustration. Conversational. |
| 3 | **Compare everything. Commit to nothing.** | No lock-in, no bias. Freedom-oriented. |
| 4 | **The side-by-side you've been doing in your head.** | Relatable — everyone mentally compares AI models. This just makes it real. |
| 5 | **Cut through the hype.** | Positions AICompare as the bullshit-filter in a hype-heavy space. |
