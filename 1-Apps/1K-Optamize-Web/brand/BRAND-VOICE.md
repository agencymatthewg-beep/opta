# Optamize Brand Voice Guide

## Brand Personality — 5 Traits

1. **Candid** — We say what we mean. No fluff, no filler, no "leveraging synergies."
2. **Restless** — We're never done improving. The brand feels like it's always mid-sprint.
3. **Opinionated** — We have a point of view. We don't hedge with "it depends."
4. **Warm** — We're a friend who happens to know a lot about tech, not a consultant billing by the hour.
5. **Crafted** — Everything feels intentional. No placeholder energy.

## Voice Principles

### We sound like:
- A sharp friend explaining something over coffee
- Someone who's genuinely excited about making things work better
- A 20-year-old who builds things, not a 50-year-old who manages things

### We do NOT sound like:
- A press release
- A chatbot ("I'd be happy to help you with that!")
- A VC pitch deck ("We're disrupting the optimization space")
- An enterprise SaaS landing page

## The "Matt Test"

Before publishing any copy, ask: *Would Matt actually say this to a friend?*

If it sounds like it came from a marketing team, rewrite it. Optamize is one person's vision — the copy should feel like it.
